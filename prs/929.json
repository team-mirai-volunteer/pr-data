For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n+     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n+     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n+     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n+\n+  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n+     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n+     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n+\n+  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n+     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n+     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n+     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n+     categorized.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n+     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n+     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n+     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n+     agreements.\n+\n+  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n+     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n+     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n+\n+  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n+     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n+     License.\n+\n+  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n+     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n+     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n+     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n+\n+  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n+     under this Public License.\n+\n+  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n+     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n+     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n+     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n+     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n+     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n+     individually chosen by them.\n+\n+  j.

License grant.\n+\n+       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n+          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n+          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n+          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n+\n+            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n+               in part; and\n+\n+            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n+\n+       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n+          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n+          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n+          its terms and conditions.\n+\n+       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n+          6(a).\n+\n+       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n+          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n+          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n+          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n+          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n+          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n+          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n+          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n+          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n+          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n+          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n+\n+       5. Downstream recipients.\n+\n+            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n+               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n+               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n+               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n+               Public License.\n+\n+            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n+               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n+               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n+               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n+               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n+               Material.\n+\n+       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n+          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n+          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n+          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n+          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n+          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n+\n+  b. Other rights.\n+\n+       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n+          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n+          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n+          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n+          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n+          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n+          Rights, but not otherwise.\n+\n+       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n+          Public License.\n+\n+       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n+          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n+          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n+          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n+          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n+          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n+\n+\n+Section 3 -- License Conditions.\n+\n+Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\n+following conditions.\n+\n+  a. Attribution.\n+\n+       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n+          form), You must:\n+\n+            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n+               with the Licensed Material:\n+\n+                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n+                    Material and any others designated to receive\n+                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n+                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n+                    designated);\n+\n+                ii. a copyright notice;\n+\n+               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n+\n+                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n+                    warranties;\n+\n+                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n+                    extent reasonably practicable;\n+\n+            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n+               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n+\n+            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n+               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n+               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n+\n+       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n+          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n+          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n+          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n+          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n+          information.\n+\n+       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n+          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n+          reasonably practicable.\n+\n+       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n+          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n+          Material from complying with this Public License.\n+\n+\n+Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n+\n+Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\n+apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n+\n+  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n+     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n+     portion of the contents of the database;\n+\n+  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n+     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n+     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n+     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n+\n+  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n+     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n+\n+For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\n+replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\n+Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n+\n+\n+Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n+\n+  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n+     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n+     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n+     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n+     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n+     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n+     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n+     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n+     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n+\n+  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n+     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n+     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n+     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n+     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n+     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n+     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n+     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n+     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n+\n+  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n+     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n+     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n+     waiver of all liability.\n+\n+\n+Section 6 -- Term and Termination.\n+\n+  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n+     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n+     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n+     terminate automatically.\n+\n+  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n+     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n+\n+       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n+          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n+          violation; or\n+\n+       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n+\n+     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n+     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n+     of this Public License.\n+\n+  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n+     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n+     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n+     will not terminate this Public License.\n+\n+  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n+     License.\n+\n+\n+Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n+\n+  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n+     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n+\n+  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n+     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n+     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n+\n+\n+Section 8 -- Interpretation.\n+\n+  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n+     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n+     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n+     be made without permission under this Public License.\n+\n+  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n+     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n+     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n+     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n+     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n+     conditions.\n+\n+  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n+     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n+     Licensor.\n+\n+  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n+     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n+     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n+     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n+\n+\n+=======================================================================\n+\n+Creative Commons is not a party to its public\n+licenses.
